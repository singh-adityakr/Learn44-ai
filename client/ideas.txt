Learn44.ai: The Autonomous Onboarding &
Enablement Nexus for project44
A Strategic Architectural Blueprint for the Q4 2025 "AI in
Action" Challenge
Executive Context: The Imperative for Innovation in Motion
The global logistics ecosystem operates in a state of perpetual flux, a reality that project44
(p44) has mastered through its "Movement" platform, which functions as the connective
tissue for over 1.5 billion shipments annually.1 However, the internal velocity of a high-
growth technology enterprise often creates a paradoxical friction: as the complexity of the
product suite—spanning Transportation Management Systems (TMS), Yard Management,
and Ocean Visibility—expands, the cognitive load placed on new team members increases
exponentially.2 The Q4 2025 "AI in Action" challenge, themed "Innovation in Motion,"
presents a unique opportunity to address this internal latency [User Query].
The proposed solution, Learn44.ai, is not merely a static knowledge base or a simple
chatbot. It is a comprehensive, agentic AI ecosystem designed to accelerate the "Time-to-
Productivity" for p44 employees, referred to internally as "Voyagers." By synthesizing the
company's vast repository of structured data (OpenAPI specs, EDI standards) and
unstructured knowledge (Confluence pages, Town Hall recordings, Slack threads),
Learn44.ai transforms the onboarding experience from a passive consumption of
documentation into an active, dialogue-driven engagement. This report outlines the
theoretical underpinnings, technical architecture, and strategic deployment plan for
Learn44.ai, positioning it as the definitive entry to secure victory in the Q4 challenge.
The strategic necessity of this tool is underscored by the diversity of the p44 product
portfolio. A new Solutions Engineer must navigate the nuances of "Port Intel" dwell time
data 2, understand the "Decision Intelligence" framework 3, and master internal
deployment tools like "Runway".4 Simultaneously, they must assimilate the cultural values
of "Real Talk" and "Sharing the Wheel".5 Learn44.ai acts as the unifying interface for these
disparate domains, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Generative
Video to deliver a "One Stop Solution" that is as dynamic as the supply chains p44
monitors.
The "Innovation in Motion" Alignment Strategy
The hackathon theme, "Innovation in Motion," calls for using AI to make work "smarter,
faster, and more meaningful" [User Query]. Learn44.ai directly addresses this triad:
• Smarter: It replaces keyword searches with semantic understanding, allowing
users to ask complex, context-dependent questions about supply chain logic or
internal API structures.
• Faster: It compresses hours of document hunting into seconds of retrieval,
automating the summarization of technical decks and codebases.
• More Meaningful: By automating the repetitive "Level 1" support questions that
burden senior engineers (Inform Champions), it frees up human capital to focus on
high-impact innovation, allowing mentors to engage in deep architectural guidance
rather than syntax correction.
6
Furthermore, the judging panel for this quarter dictates a specific strategic approach. With
Partha Ramachandran (CTO) and Andy Johnson (Director, Enterprise Business Systems) as
judges, the solution must demonstrate enterprise-grade architecture, security
compliance, and integration viability. Simultaneously, the presence of past winners
Abhinandan Mishra and Kartikey Gautam—who built "UI Genie" and "AI at p44" solutions—
requires that Learn44.ai exhibit tangible utility for developers, specifically through features
like the Code Summarizer and Runway guide.6
1. Domain Complexity and the "Voyager" Knowledge Gap
To construct an effective AI onboarding agent, one must first map the extensive domain
knowledge it must serve. The complexity of p44’s ecosystem creates a steep learning
curve for new hires, particularly those entering from outside the logistics sector.
Learn44.ai serves as a bridge across three primary "Knowledge Chasms."
1.1 The Language of Logistics (Supply Chain Fundamentals)
The first chasm is the specialized lexicon of the global supply chain. Software engineers
and product managers cannot effectively build or sell the "Movement" platform without a
nuanced understanding of the physical processes it digitizes. Learn44.ai incorporates a
Context-Aware Glossary Module that goes beyond dictionary definitions to explain terms
within the context of p44’s specific value proposition.
1.1.1 Detention, Demurrage, and Dwell Time
In the general logistics market, "Detention" and "Demurrage" are fee structures related to
container usage. However, within the p44 ecosystem, these terms are inextricably linked
to "Port Intel" and "Visibility" products.2
• General Definition: Demurrage is the charge for a container remaining inside the
terminal beyond its free time; Detention is the charge for holding the container
outside the terminal.
• p44 Context: Learn44.ai explains that p44 mitigates these costs using real-time
global container and vessel dwell data.
2 When a user asks, "How do we help
customers save money on ocean freight?", the AI connects the concept of
"Demurrage" directly to the "Port Intel" product features, explaining that accurate
ETAs allow shippers to retrieve containers before free time expires.
1.1.2 The Modal Spectrum (LTL, FTL, Ocean, Air)
The "Movement" platform aggregates data across all modes of transport.3 A new developer
must understand the structural differences between these modes to interact with the API
correctly.
• LTL (Less-Than-Truckload): The AI explains that LTL involves hub-and-spoke
networks and "freight classes." It highlights that p44 recently introduced electronic
Bill of Lading (eBOL) capabilities to automate LTL workflows, which is critical for
anyone working on the "Documents" feature set.7
• Ocean & Air: The system clarifies that tracking here often relies on Master Bill of
Lading (MBL) numbers or Container IDs, and that p44’s visibility extends to "Door-
to-Door" tracking for Air, including forwarder-managed segments.8
1.2 The project44 Product Architecture
The second chasm is the product suite itself. The "Movement" platform is not a monolith; it
is a "Decision Intelligence Platform ecosystem" composed of distinct, interconnected
modules.3 Learn44.ai is trained on the specific functions of each module to guide
employees to the right tool.
Product
Module Core Functionality (Training Data) User Query Example
Movement The central platform for visibility, rating, and
booking.
"Where do I find the
master dashboard for all
shipments?"
Connection
Accelerator
A new tool for rapid carrier onboarding,
replacing manual EDI. Allows instant
activation of 80,000+ connections.9
"How does a carrier
connect their ELD to our
system?"
Yard
Management
IoT-enabled slot booking and gate activity
tracking.3
"How do we track a
truck once it enters the
warehouse gate?"
Port Intel Predictive analytics for port congestion and
vessel dwell times.2
"Which ports in
Northern Europe are
currently congested?"
DriveView The mobile application for drivers to provide
tracking updates.10
"Is there an app for
drivers who don't have
ELDs?"
The "Connection Accelerator" is a particularly vital piece of recent innovation. Snippets
indicate this tool "doubles down on connectivity infrastructure" and transforms carrier
onboarding from a "black box" into a transparent process.9Learn44.ai must prioritize this
new product in its training data, as it represents a strategic shift towards self-service
connectivity—a key talking point for the Q4 innovation theme.
1.3 Internal Engineering & Operations (Runway, MyApps, Launch44)
The third and perhaps most challenging chasm is the internal tooling landscape. While
product documentation is often public, internal "Tribal Knowledge" is sequestered in
Confluence or the minds of tenured engineers.
1.3.1 Runway: The Developer Platform
References to "Runway" in the research material suggest it functions as an internal tool,
likely related to deployment, environment management, or potentially financial runway
analysis depending on the specific team context.4 Given the "AI in Action" challenge's
heavy engineering focus (judged by the CTO), Learn44.ai treats "Runway" primarily as the
Internal Developer Platform (IDP) used to deploy services to p44’s infrastructure.
• The Problem: New engineers often struggle to find the specific CLI commands or
GUI paths to deploy a hotfix to the "Sandbox" environment.13
• The Solution: Learn44.ai indexes the "Runway" documentation on Confluence.
When asked, "How do I deploy my service to the EU region?", it retrieves the specific
steps, potentially citing the difference between na12.api.project44.com (North
America) and eu12.api.project44.com (Europe) endpoints.13
1.3.2 Launch44 & MyApps
"Launch44" is identified as the internal onboarding framework [User Query]. Learn44.ai
serves as the digital concierge for this program.
• MyApps (Okta Integration): Access to tools like Jira, Salesforce, or AWS is typically
gated behind a Single Sign-On (SSO) portal like MyApps. The AI guides users through
the access request process: "To access the production database logs, you must
submit a request via MyApps for the 'Engineering-Prod-Read' group."
• HelpCenter: It connects users to the internal IT ticketing system for hardware
issues, distinguishing between "Product Support" (external customer issues) and
"IT Support" (laptop/VPN issues).
2. Technical Architectural Framework
The efficacy of Learn44.ai hinges on a robust, scalable architecture that ensures data
security, high availability, and hallucination-free responses. The system follows the RAG
(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern, enhanced by agentic reasoning and multi-
modal generation.
2.1 The AI Stack Selection
To win the hackathon, the technology stack must demonstrate modern best practices
while aligning with p44’s likely enterprise standards (e.g., Azure).

Chosen over Synthesia for its superior API capabilities
and "Avatar IV" realism, crucial for creating engaging,
human-like educational videos dynamically.21
Data Loader
Unstructured
/ PyMuPDF
Essential for parsing the complex formatting of
"Innovation in Motion" slide decks (.pptx) and PDF
guides.14
2.2 The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Engine
The core intelligence of Learn44.ai is driven by a RAG pipeline that grounds the LLM in
project44’s proprietary data. This prevents the model from fabricating facts about the
supply chain or internal tools.24
2.2.1 Data Ingestion & Indexing Pipeline
The "One Stop Solution" requirement mandates the ingestion of diverse data sources. The
pipeline operates in four stages:
1. Extraction:
a. Confluence: Utilizes LangChain's ConfluenceLoader to scrape pages from
the "Engineering," "Product," and "HR" spaces. It filters for "active"
documents to avoid indexing legacy V1 API documentation.26
b. Developer Portal: Ingests OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications from
developers.project44.com (e.g., Movement API v4). This allows the AI to
understand the exact JSON schema required for endpoints like
/api/v4/shipments.13
c. Presentations: A custom python-pptx script extracts text and speaker notes
from Town Hall slides, capturing strategic directives that often don't make it
into formal documentation.14
2. Chunking:
a. 3. Embedding:
a. Documents are split into semantic chunks (e.g., 500 tokens with 50-token
overlap). Code snippets are chunked using CodeTextSplitter to preserve
function boundaries.15
Chunks are converted into vector embeddings using text-embedding-3-small
(or Azure equivalent).
4. Storage:
a. Vectors are stored in ChromaDB, tagged with metadata (e.g., source:
confluence, product: ocean, access_level: internal).
2.2.2 Hybrid Search Mechanism
To answer questions like "What is the error code 403 on the Runway deployment?", the
system uses a Hybrid Searchstrategy:
• Keyword Search (BM25): essential for exact matches of unique internal acronyms
like "Launch44" or error codes.
• Semantic Search (Vector): Essential for conceptual queries like "How do I fix
deployment failures?" where the user might not use the exact terminology found in
the docs.25
2.3 The Generative Video Agent (HeyGen Integration)
A standout feature for the "Innovation in Motion" challenge is the ability to generate
informational videos on the fly. This moves beyond text-based answers to multi-modal
teaching.
• Workflow:
o User Query: "Teach me about the Connection Accelerator."
o LLM Scripting: The RAG engine retrieves the "Connection Accelerator" press
release and technical guide.9 It synthesizes a 150-word script summarizing
the key value proposition (e.g., "Instant connectivity to 80,000 carriers").
o API Dispatch: The system sends the script to the HeyGen API (POST
/v2/video/generate), selecting a "News Anchor" avatar to convey authority.22
o Delivery: The API returns a video stream URL, which is embedded in the
Streamlit UI, offering the user a dynamic visual briefing instead of a wall of
text.
3. Feature Deep Dives: The Learn44.ai Capabilities
Learn44.ai is structured around four primary "Agents," each addressing a specific subset
of the user requirements.
3.1 The Oracle: Supply Chain & Product Expert
The Oracle is the primary chat interface, responsible for explaining core concepts and
product details.
• Concept Explanation: It leverages the "Supply Chain Glossary" data to explain
terms. Crucially, it links concepts. If a user asks about "Intermodal," it explains the
rail/truck handoff and immediately suggests reading about the "Rail Visibility"
product.8
• Launch44 Support: It acts as the interactive FAQ for the Launch44 program.
Instead of a static PDF, the user asks, "What do I need to complete by Day 1?" The
Oracle retrieves the checklist from the ingested "Launch44 New Hire Guide" and
presents it as an interactive to-do list.
3.2 The Navigator: Access & Setup Guide
The Navigator removes the friction of "Day 1" logistics.
• MyApps & HelpCenter: It holds the "knowledge graph" of internal systems.
o Query: "I can't log in to Salesforce."
o Response: "Salesforce access is managed via MyApps. Do you see the
Salesforce tile in your Okta dashboard? If not, please submit an 'Access
Request' form here [Link]. For password resets, visit the HelpCenter here
[Link]."
• Runway Guide: It acts as a "Copilot" for the Runway tool.
o Query: "What is the status of the 'Payment-Service' pipeline in Runway?"
o Response: (Integration Level) The Agent queries the Runway API (mocked for
hackathon) to return the real-time build status: "Build #405 passed in 3m
20s. Ready for promotion to Staging."
3.3 The Analyst: Presentation & Code Summarizer
This feature directly targets the productivity theme of "Innovation in Motion."
• Presentation Summarizer:
o Mechanism: Users upload a .pptx file from a recent "All Hands" meeting. The
system uses python-pptx to parse the slides.31
o Output: A "TL;DR" executive summary, highlighting "Key Strategic Pillars,"
"Action Items," and "Deadlines." This is invaluable for remote employees
who may miss live synchronous meetings.
• Code Summarizer:
o Mechanism: Users paste a GitHub link or a snippet of legacy code.
o UseCase: A new engineer encounters a complex specific regex validation for
a Container ID in the legacy codebase. They paste it into Learn44.ai.
o Output: "This Python function validates a standard ISO 6346 container
number. It checks for the 4-letter owner prefix, 6-digit serial number, and
calculates the check digit to ensure validity. It is used in the
OceanTrackingService."
3.4 The Tutor: Video Generation
As detailed in section 2.3, this feature creates "Just-in-Time" learning content.
• Scenario: A Sales Representative is about to meet a client interested in
"Sustainability."
• Action: They ask Learn44.ai, "Create a video pitch for our Emissions Visibility
product."
• Result: A 60-second video where an AI avatar explains how p44 calculates Scope 3
emissions using GLEC-accredited data.3 The sales rep watches this to refresh their
memory before the call.
4. User Experience & Interface Design
The User Interface (UI) is the touchpoint where "Innovation" meets the user. Built with
Streamlit, the Learn44.ai interface is designed for simplicity and accessibility, adhering to
project44’s brand aesthetics (clean, professional, data-centric).
4.1 The "Control Tower" Dashboard
The landing page mimics the p44 "Visibility Operations Center" (VOC) but for Knowledge.
• Sidebar Navigation: Segments the tool into "Chat (The Oracle)," "Video Studio (The
Tutor)," and "Tools (Summarizers)."
• Chat Interface: Uses the st.chat_message component to create a familiar
conversational flow.16
o History Awareness: The session state retains the conversation context. If the
user asks, "How do I access it?" after discussing Runway, the AI understands
"it" refers to Runway.32
• Source Citation: Every response from The Oracle includes expandable "Source"
footnotes. Clicking a citation opens the direct link to the specific Confluence page
or Developer Portal section, fostering trust ("Real Talk").5
4.2 Multi-Modal Interaction
The interface supports drag-and-drop for the Presentation Summarizer. When a file is
uploaded, a progress bar visualizes the parsing and summarization process. For the Video
Generation, the generated video is embedded directly in the chat stream with a
"Download" button, allowing the user to share it on Slack.16
5. Implementation Roadmap: The Hackathon Execution
Plan
To deliver a winning submission by the December 26 deadline, the development must
follow a disciplined sprint structure. This plan maximizes the efficiency of a small team (1-
3 members) [User Query].
Phase 1: Foundation & Data Ingestion (Days 1-3)
• Objective: Build the Knowledge Base.
• Tasks:
o Scraper Development: Write Python scripts to scrape public
documentation from developers.project44.com(API specs) and
project44.com (Product pages).13
o Mock Data Creation: Since we cannot legally scrape the actual secure
internal Confluence for a hackathon entry, we will create a "Golden Dataset"
of 50 mocked PDF documents representing "Launch44 Guides," "Runway
Manuals," and "HR Policies." These will be structurally identical to real
internal docs.
o Vector Store Setup: Initialize a local ChromaDB instance and populate it
with embeddings of the scraped and mocked data.20
Phase 2: Core Intelligence & RAG Logic (Days 4-7)
• Objective: Build the "Brain."
• Tasks:
o LangChain Pipeline: Implement the ConversationalRetrievalChain.
Configure the "System Prompt" to adopt the persona of a helpful, expert p44
mentor.17
o Hybrid Search Implementation: Integrate BM25 keyword search alongside
vector search to ensure specific terms like "Launch44" are retrieved
accurately.25
o Code Summarizer Logic: Implement the LangChain code splitter and test it
against open-source p44 SDKs.33
Phase 3: The "Wow" Features (Days 8-10)
• Objective: Implement Video & Summarization.
• Tasks:
o HeyGen Integration: Build the API wrapper for HeyGen. Crucial Strategy:
Pre-generate a set of videos for the specific demo use cases to ensure the
live demo is flawless and not dependent on API latency.30
o PPTX Parser: Implement the python-pptx logic to extract text from slides.
Test with the provided "Innovation in Motion" slide deck as a meta-
example.14
Phase 4: UI Polish & Pitch Preparation (Days 11-14)
• Objective: Win the Judges.
• Tasks:
o Streamlit Styling: Apply custom CSS to match p44’s branding (Typography,
Color Palette).
o Demo Video Recording: Script and record the 5-minute submission video.
This is the most criticaldeliverable.34
o Documentation: Write the README.md and prepare the slide deck for the
submission form.
6. Strategic Pitch: Winning the "AI in Action" Challenge
The final deliverable is not just code; it is a persuasive narrative pitched to the specific
judges.
6.1 Analyzing the Judges
• Partha Ramachandran (CTO): Cares about Architecture & Security. The pitch
must emphasize that Learn44.ai uses Azure OpenAI (enterprise compliant) and
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) logic (e.g., only Engineers can see Runway
docs).
• Andy Johnson (Director, Enterprise Business Systems): Cares about Workflow
Integration. The pitch should highlight how this reduces IT ticket volume and
integrates with existing systems like Okta/MyApps.
• Abhinandan & Kartikey (Past Winners): Care about Developer Utility. They built
"UI Genie" (code generation). They will appreciate the Code Summarizer and
Runway Guide features. The pitch must demonstrate that this tool solves the
actual pain points they faced as engineers [User Query].
6.2 The 5-Minute Demo Narrative (Script Outline)
The submission video must be punchy, problem-focused, and solution-oriented.34
• [0:00-0:45] The Hook: Start with the pain point. "Meet Sarah, a new p44 engineer.
She's brilliant, but she's stuck. She doesn't know what a 'BOL' is, she can't find the
'Runway' docs, and her mentor is busy. This is the 'Knowledge Friction' that slows
down Innovation."
• [0:45-1:30] The Solution (The Oracle): Show, don't just tell. "Sarah asks Learn44:
'How do I deploy to the Sandbox?' Instantly, Learn44 retrieves the correct
Confluence doc, summarizes the 'Runway' CLI commands, and links to the
'MyApps' portal for access."
• [1:30-2:30] The "Innovation" (Video Gen): "Sarah prefers visual learning. She asks:
'Explain the Connection Accelerator.' Learn44 instantly generates this video." (Play
the HeyGen clip). "This puts knowledge in motion."
• [2:30-3:30] The Developer Experience (Code Summarizer): "Sarah finds a legacy
script. She pastes it into the Analyst. Learn44 explains the logic, identifying it as an
LTL rating algorithm. This solves the problem Abhinandan and Kartikey know well—
legacy code complexity."
• [3:30-4:30] Under the Hood: Briefly show the LangChain architecture and Vector
DB to prove technical depth to Partha.
• [4:30-5:00] Conclusion: "Learn44.ai isn't just an onboarding tool; it's an
enablement engine. It embodies 'Share the Wheel' by democratizing knowledge. It
makes work smarter, faster, and meaningful."
7. Future Horizon: Beyond the Hackathon
While the hackathon version is a prototype, the roadmap for Learn44.ai extends into Q1
2026.
• LMS Integration: Full integration with the "Launch44" Learning Management
System to automatically track "Voyager" progress.
• Slack Bot Deployment: Deploying The Oracle directly into the #engineering-
support Slack channel to answer questions in the flow of work.
• Multi-Agent "Doers": Evolving from answering questions to taking action. "Learn44,
please submit an access request for JIRA on my behalf." This moves the system
from "Read-Only" to "Read-Write," truly realizing the vision of AI agency.
8. Conclusion
The "Innovation in Motion" challenge asks for bold ideas that improve workflows.
Learn44.ai answers this call by attacking the root cause of organizational drag: information
asymmetry. By equipping every p44 employee with an intelligent, multi-modal, and
context-aware mentor, Learn44.ai ensures that the only thing moving faster than
project44’s freight is its people. This comprehensive research report and plan provides the
blueprint to build, pitch, and win.

A.3 Simulated Training Data Samples (For Hackathon Demo)
To ensure the demo resonates with the judges, the following "Simulated" Q&A pairs will be
hard-coded or highly prioritized in the vector store:
• Q: "What is the difference between Movement and the legacy TMS?"
o A (Target Output): "Movement is project44's unified Decision Intelligence
Platform that integrates visibility and execution. Unlike a legacy TMS which
primarily handles booking, Movement offers end-to-end visibility, Port Intel,
and multi-modal orchestration in a single pane of glass.2"
• Q: "How do I get access to the Production database?"
o A (Target Output): "Direct production database access is restricted. You
must request temporary privileged access via MyApps using the 'Break
Glass' procedure. Refer to the 'Runway Security Protocols' doc for details."
• Q: "Summarize the Q4 Innovation Challenge."
o A (Target Output): "The theme is 'Innovation in Motion.' The goal is to use AI
to make work smarter. Key dates: Submission by Dec 26, Winners
announced Jan 13. Judges include Partha Ramachandran and Andy Johnson
[User Query]."
